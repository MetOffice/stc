# STC - SciTools Commands

 Command line tools build on top of the [SciTools](https://scitools.org.uk/) libraries to work with
 scientific data related to the [Unified Model](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/unified-model/index). STC is a small utility project, provided as it is without further development or support plans.

## Installation

```
mkdir  ~/opt
git clone git@github.com:MetOffice/stc.git ~/opt/stc
```

Add ~/opt/stc to your PATH by including

```
export PATH=~/opt/stc:${PATH}
```

in your ~/.bashrc file.
